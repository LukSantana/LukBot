# discordBot
This is a Discord bot i made to practice Javascript and use it in my personal Discord Server.
<hr>

In this project i used the Javascript library discord.js and discord.js/voice.<br>
This bot is pretty simple, for now it just plays a snore meme sound when a Discord server member send the command "!sleep"<br>
I'm working on adding more features to it.
