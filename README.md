# discordBot
This is a Discord bot i made to practice Javascript and use it in my personal Discord Server.
<hr>

In this project i used the Javascript library discord.js and discord.js/voice.<br>
This bot is pretty simple, for now it just plays some meme sounds whenever a specific command is sent on any text channel of a Discord server that the bot's in.
